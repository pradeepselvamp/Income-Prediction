# Income-Prediction

Income of an individual is predicted from basic demographic data obtained from one of the online merchants using 5 below algorithms:
1. Support Vector Machines
2. Decision Trees
3. Boosting
4. Neural Networks
5. KNN

Performance of these 5 algorithms is then compared.

# GPU Performance Prediction

The same 5 algorithms is used here as well.
